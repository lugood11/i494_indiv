Hello, my name is Luke Goodman and I am currently a Senior studying Informatics with minors in Business and Chinese. I am from a southside Chicago suburb and enjoy watching sports, tv shows, playing chess, and also spend a lot of my free time working at the Wright Food Court. After college I hope to work in the Data Analytics field and would like to utilize the skills learned in this class for my future endeavors.
